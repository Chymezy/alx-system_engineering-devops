12:00 PM UTC: The issue was resolved by re-indexing the data and updating the Elasticsearch configuration.
Root Cause and Resolution

The root cause of the issue was a misconfigured Elasticsearch index, which caused the search service to fail. The index was not properly updated after a recent data migration, leading to inconsistencies in the data. This caused the search service to return errors when attempting to query the index.

The issue was resolved by re-indexing the data and updating the Elasticsearch configuration to ensure consistency with the new data structure.

Corrective and Preventative Measures

Improve the data migration process to ensure that Elasticsearch indexes are properly updated.
Add monitoring to detect inconsistencies in the Elasticsearch index.
Implement automated testing for the search service to catch issues earlier.
Update the incident response process to include a checklist for common issues, such as misconfigured Elasticsearch indexes.
Tasks to address the issue:

Patch Elasticsearch to the latest version to ensure bug fixes and improvements.
Develop a script to automate the re-indexing process in case of future data migrations.
Schedule a review of the data migration process with the infrastructure team to identify areas for improvement.
