ENERGY CONSUMPTION TRACKER

Let's break down the implementation sequence based on the user stories:

User Story 1: User Registration and Login

    models.py: Define the User model to store username, email, and password.
    resources/auth.py: Implement authentication and authorization logic for registration and login.
    resources/user.py: Implement API endpoints for user registration and login.
    app.py: Integrate the authentication and authorization logic with the API framework.
    frontend/src/components/Login.js: Create the login form component.
    frontend/src/components/Register.js: Create the registration form component.
    frontend/src/App.js: Implement the login and registration functionality in the App component.

User Story 2: Adding Energy Consumption Data

    models.py: Define the EnergyConsumption model to store daily energy consumption data.
    resources/energy.py: Implement API endpoints for adding and saving energy consumption data.
    frontend/src/components/EnergyRecordForm.js: Create the energy record form component.
    frontend/src/components/EnergyRecordList.js: Create the energy record list component.
    frontend/src/App.js: Implement the energy record addition functionality in the App component.

User Story 3: Viewing Energy Consumption Trends

    resources/analytics.py: Implement API endpoints for retrieving energy consumption data for a selected date range.
    frontend/src/components/Analytics.js: Create the analytics component to display the line chart using Chart.js.
    frontend/src/App.js: Implement the analytics functionality in the App component.

User Story 4: Updating Energy Consumption Data

    resources/energy.py: Implement API endpoints for updating and deleting energy consumption data.
    frontend/src/components/EnergyRecordList.js: Update the energy record list component to allow editing and deleting entries.
    frontend/src/App.js: Implement the energy record update and deletion functionality in the App component.

User Story 5: Average Energy Consumption Insights

    resources/analytics.py: Implement API endpoints for calculating and retrieving average energy consumption data.
    frontend/src/components/Analytics.js: Update the analytics component to display average energy consumption data.
    frontend/src/App.js: Implement the average energy consumption insights functionality in the App component.

By following this sequence, you'll implement the user stories in a logical order, building upon the previous functionality.
